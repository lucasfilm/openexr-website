<p>OpenEXR provides the specification and reference implementation of
the EXR file format, the professional-grade image storage format of
the motion picture industry. The purpose of format is to accurately
and efficiently represent high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data
and associated metadata, with strong support for multi-part,
multi-channel use cases. The library is widely used in host
application software where accuracy is critical, such as
photorealistic rendering, texture access, image compositing, deep
compositing, and DI.</p>

<p>OpenEXR a project of the <a href="https://www.aswf.io/"
target="_blank">Academy Software Foundation</a> and is part of
the <a href="https://vfxplatform.com/" target="_blank">VFX Reference
Platform.</a> OpenEXR was originally developed by Industrial Light &
Magic (ILM) and first released in 2003. Weta Digital, Walt Disney
Animation Studios, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios,
DreamWorks, and other studios, companies, and individuals have made
significant contributions to the code base.
</p>

<p><h2><a name="mission">Mission Statement</a></h2>

<p>The goal of the OpenEXR project is to keep the format reliable and
modern and to maintain its place as the preferred image format for
entertainment content creation. Major revisions are infrequent, and
new features will be carefully weighed against increased complexity.</p>

<p>The principal priorities of the project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robustness, reliability, security</li>
<li>Backwards compatibility, data longevity</li>
<li>Performance - read/write/compression/decompression time</li>
<li>Simplicity, ease of use, maintainability</li>
<li>Wide adoption, multi-platform support - Linux, Windows, macOS, and others</li>
</ul>

<p>OpenEXR is intended solely for 2D data. It is not appropriate for
storage of volumetric data, cached or lit 3D scenes, or more complex
3D data such as light fields.</p>

<p><h2><a name="features">OpenEXR Features</a></h2>

<p>OpenEXR's features include:

<ul>

<li>High dynamic range and color precision.</li>
<li>Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels.</li>
<li>Multiple image compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy. Some of the included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain. The lossy codecs have been tuned for visual quality and decoding performance.</li>
<li>Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.</li>
<li>Support for stereoscopic image workflows and a generalization to multi-views.</li>
<li>Flexible support for deep data: pixels can store a variable-length list of samples and, thus, it is possible to store multiple values at different depths for each pixel. Hard surfaces and volumetric data representations are accommodated.</li>
<li>Multipart: ability to encode separate, but related, images in one file. This allows for access to individual parts without the need to read other parts in the file.</li>
<li>Versioning: OpenEXR source allows for user configurable C++ namespaces to provide protection when using multiple versions of the library in the same process space.</li>

</ul>

<p><h2><a name="v3">OpenEXR and Imath Version 3</a></h2>

<p>With the release of OpenEXR 3, the Imath library formerly distributed
via the IlmBase component of OpenEXR is now an independent library
dependency, available for download from <a href="https:://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath.">https:://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath.</a>
You can choose to build OpenEXR against an external installation of
Imath, or the default CMake configuration will download and build it
automatically during the OpenEXR build process.  Note that the half
16-bit floating point data type is included in Imath.</p>

<h3>July 22, 2021 - OpenEXR v3.1.0</h3>

<p>The 3.1 release of OpenEXR introduces a new library, OpenEXRCore,
which is the result of a significant re-thinking of how OpenEXR
manages file I/O and provides access to image data. It begins to
address long-standing scalability issues with multithreaded image
reading and writing.</p>

<p>The OpenEXRCore library provides thread-safe, non-blocking access to
files, which was not possible with the current API, where the
framebuffer management is separate from read requests. It is written
entirely in C and provides a new C-language API alongside the existing
C++ API. This new low-level API allows applications to do custom
unpacking of EXR data, such as on the GPU, while still benefiting from
efficient I/O, file validation, and other semantics. It provides
efficient direct access to EXR files in texturing applications. This C
library also introduces an easier path to implementing OpenEXR
bindings in other languages, such as Rust.</p>

<p>The 3.1 release represents a technology preview for upcoming
releases. The initial release is incremental; the existing API and
underlying behavior has not changed. The new API is available now for
performance validation testing, and then in future OpenEXR releases,
the C++ API will migrate to use the new core in stages.  It is not the
intention to entirely deprecate the C++ API, nor must all applications
re-implement EXR I/O in terms of the C library. The C API does not,
and will not, provide the rich set of utility classes that exist in
the C++ layer. The 3.1 release of the OpenEXRCore library simply
offers new functionality for specialty applications seeking the
highest possible performance. In the future, the ABI will evolve, but
the API will remain consistent, or only have additions. </p>

<h4>Technical Design</h4>

<p>The OpenEXRCore API introduces a ``context`` object to manage file
I/O. The context provides customization for I/O, memory allocation,
and error handling.  This makes it possible to use a decode and/or
encode pipeline to customize how the chunks are written and read, and
how they are packed or unpacked.</p>

<p>The OpenEXRCore library is built around the concept of “chunks”, or
atomic blocks of data in a file, the smallest unit of data to be read
or written.  The contents of a chunk vary from file to file based on
compression (i.e. zip and zips) and layout (scanline
vs. tiled). Currently this is either 1, 16, or 32 scanlines, or 1 tile
(or subset of a tile on edge boundaries / small mip level).</p>

<p>The OpenEXRCore library is specifically designed for multipart EXR
files. It will continue to produce legacy-compatible single part files
as needed, but the API assumes you are always dealing with a
multi-part file. It also fully supports attributes, although being C,
it lacks some of the C++ layer’s abstraction.</p>

<h4>Limitations:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>No support yet for DWAA and DWAB compression during decode and
    encode pipelines. The low-level chunk I/O still works with DWAA
    and DWAB compressed files, but the encoder and decoder are not yet
    included in this release.</li>

  <li>For deep files, reading of deep data is functional, but the path
    for encoding deep data into chunk-level data (i.e. packing and
    compressing) is not yet complete.</li>

  <li>For both of these deficiencies, it is easy to define a custom
    routine to implement this, should it be needed prior to the
    library providing full support.</li>

  <li>No attempt to search through the file and find missing chunks is
    made when a corrupt chunk table is encountered. However, if a
    particular chunk is corrupt, this is handled such that the other
    chunks may be read without rendering the context unusable</li>

<h3>July 13, 2021 - Imath v3.1.0</h3>

<p>Minor release with new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optimized half-to-float and float-to-half conversion, using F16C
    SSE instruction set if available. Non-SSE conversion eliminates the
    float-to-half exponent lookup table, and half-to-float conversion
    provides a compile-time-optional bit shifting that is slower but
    eliminates the need for the lookup table, for applications where
    memory is limited.</li>

  <li> Half-to-float and float-to-half conversion is also available as
    C-language functions <tt>imath_half_to_float()</tt> and
    <tt>imath_float_to_half()</tt>.</li>
  
  <li> All new conversions produced identical results, and new options are
    off by default to ensure backwards compatibility. See
    <a href="https://imath.readthedocs.io">https://imath.readthedocs.io</a>
    for more info.</li>
  
  <li> <tt>NOEXCEPT</tt> specifier can be eliminated at compile-time via the
    <tt>IMATH_USE_NOEXCEPT</tt> CMake option.</li>

  <li> Python bindings:
    <ul>
      <li> FixedArray objects support a "read only" state. </li>
      <li> FixedArray objects support python buffer protocol.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Optimized 4x4 matrix multiplication.</li>

<h3>April 1, 2021 - OpenEXR and Imath v3.0</h3>

<p>The OpenEXR Project and the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF)
announced the official release of OpenEXR and Imath version 3.0, now
available for developers to integrate into their applications.</p>

<p>The 3.0 release of OpenEXR addresses a number of security issues and
introduces several new features, including ID Manifest attributes, but
it is primarily a major restructuring and simplification of the build
process and modernization of the code that involves moving Imath to an
external project dependency.</p>

<p>Largely backwards compatible with previous releases, Imath 3.0 brings
the library up to modern standards for performance and utility. By
promoting Imath as a project independent of OpenEXR, we hope to
encourage its use throughout the motion picture and computer graphics
community.</p>

<p>See
  the <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/master/CHANGES.md">Imath</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/blob/master/CHANGES.md">OpenEXR</a>
  release notes for details and the <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/master/docs/PortingGuide2-3.md">porting
guide</a> for more information about the differences with previous versions. And read the documentation at

<h3>March 16, 2020 - OpenEXR v3.0.0-beta</h3>

<h4>OpenEXR version v3.0.0-beta is available for download at <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta">https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta</a></h4>

<p>Major release with major build restructing, security improvements, and
new features:</p>

<ul>

  <li> Restructuring:
    <ul>
      <li> The IlmBase/PyIlmBase submodules have been separated into the
           Imath project, now included by OpenEXR via a CMake submodule
           dependency, fetched automatically via CMake's FetchContent if
           necessary.</li>
      <li> The library is now called <tt>libOpenEXR</tt> (instead of
           <tt>libIlmImf</tt>).  No header files have been renamed, they retain
           the <tt>Imf</tt> prefix.</li>
      <li> Symbol linkage visibility is limited to specific public symbols.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> Build improvements:
    <ul>
      <li> No more simultaneous static/shared build option.
        Gnu autoconf/bootstrap/configure build setup has been retired.</li>
      <li> Community-provided support for bazel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> New Features:
    <ul>
      <li> ID Manifest Attributes, as described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3233085.3233086" target="_blank">"A Scheme for
           Storing Object ID Manifests in OpenEXR Images"</a>, Peter
           Hillman, DigiPro 18: Proceedings of the 8th Annual Digital
           Production Symposium, August 2018.</li>

      <li> New program: exrcheck validates the contents of an EXR file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> Changes:
    <ul>
      <li> EXR files with no channels are no longer allowed.</li>
      <li> Hard limit on the size of deep tile sizes; tiles must be less than
           2<sup>30</sup> pixels.</li>
      <li> Tiled DWAB files used STATIC_HUFFMAN compression.
      <li> <tt>Int64</tt> and <tt>SInt64</tt> types are deprecated in favor of
           <tt>uint64_t</tt> and <tt>int64_t</tt>.</li>
      <li> Header files have been pruned of extraneous <tt>#include</tt>'s
           ("Include What You Use"), which may generate compiler errors
           in application source code from undefined symbols or
           partially-defined types. These can be resolved by identifying
           and including the appropriate header.</li>
      <li> See the <a href="https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath/blob/master/docs/PortingGuide2-3.md" target="_blank">porting
           guide</a>

           to address them.</li>

<h3>April 9, 2013 OpenEXR v2.0</h3>

<h4>Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Weta Digital announce the release of OpenEXR 2.0, the major version update of the open source high dynamic range file format first introduced by ILM and maintained and expanded by a number of key industry leaders including Weta Digital, Pixar Animation Studios, Autodesk and others.</h4>

<p>The release includes a number of new features that align with the major version number increase. Amongst the major improvements are:</p>

<ol class="general">
	<li><strong>Deep Data support</strong> - Pixels can now store a variable-length list of samples. The main rationale behind deep images is to enable the storage of multiple values at different depths for each pixel. OpenEXR 2.0 supports both hard-surface and volumetric representations for Deep Compositing workflows.</li>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Multi-part Image Files</strong> - With OpenEXR 2.0, files can now contain a number of separate, but related, data parts in one file. Access to any part is independent of the others, pixels from parts that are not required in the current operation don't need to be accessed, resulting in quicker read times when accessing only a subset of channels. The multipart interface also incorporates support for Stereo images where views are stored in separate parts. This makes stereo OpenEXR 2.0 files significantly faster to work with than the previous multiview support in OpenEXR.</li>
	<li><strong>Optimized pixel reading</strong> - decoding RGB(A) scanline images has been accelerated on SSE processors providing a significant speedup when reading both old and new format images, including multipart and multiview files.</li>
	<li><strong>Namespacing</strong> - The library introduces versioned namespaces to avoid conflicts between packages compiled with different versions of the library.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although OpenEXR 2.0 is a major version update, files created by the new library that don't exercise the new feature set are completely backwards compatible with previous versions of the library. By using the OpenEXR 2.0 library, performance improvements, namespace versions and basic multi-part/deep reading support should be available to applications without code modifications.</p>

<p>This code is designed to support Deep Compositing - a revolutionary compositing workflow developed at Weta Digital that detached the rendering of different elements in scene.  In particular, changes in one layer could be rendered separately without the need to re-render other layers that would be required to handle holdouts in a traditional comp workflow or sorting of layers in complex scenes with elements moving in depth.  Deep Compositing became the primary compositing workflow on Avatar and has seen wide industry adoption.  The technique allows depth and color value to be stored for every pixel in a scene allowing for much more efficient handling of large complex scenes and greater freedom for artists to iterate.</p>

<p>True to the open source ethos, a number of companies contributed to support the format and encourage adoption.  Amongst others, Pixar Animation Studios has contributed its DtexToExr converter to the OpenEXR repository under a Microsoft Public License, which clears any concerns about existing patents in the area, and Autodesk provided performance optimizations geared towards real-time post-production workflows.</p>

<p>Extensive effort has been put in ensuring all requirements were met to help a wide adoption, staying true to the wide success of OpenEXR. Many software companies were involved in the beta cycle to insure support amongst a number of industry leading applications. Numerous packages like SideFX's Houdini, Autodesk's Maya,  Solid Angle's Arnold renderer, Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Image IO have already announced their support of the format.</p>

<p>Open EXR 2.0 is an important step in the adoption of deep compositing as it provides a consistent file format for deep data that is easy to read and work with throughout a visual effects pipeline.  The Foundry has build OpenEXR 2.0 support into its Nuke Compositing application as the base for the Deep Compositing workflows.</p>

<p>OpenEXR 2.0 is already in use at both Weta Digital and Industrial Light & Magic. ILM took advantage of the new format on Marvel's The Avengers and two highly anticipated summer 2013 releases, Pacific Rim and The Lone Ranger.  Recent examples of Weta Digital's use of the format also include <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> as well as <em>Prometheus</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>.  In addition, a large number of visual effects studios have already integrated a deep workflow into their compositing pipelines or are in the process of doing so including:, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios, Rhythm & Hues, Fuel and MPC.</p>

<p>In addition to visual effects, the new additions to the format, means that depth data can also be assigned to two-dimensional data for a use in many design fields including, architecture, graphic design, automotive and product prototyping.</p>

<h3>June 18, 2012</h3>

<h4>We're pleased to announce the first public Beta release of OpenEXR v2.</h4>

<p>Development of OpenEXR v2 has been undertaken in a collaborative environment (cf. previous <b>github</b> announcement) comprised of Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital as well as a number of other contributors.</p>
<p>Some of the new features included in the Beta.1 release of OpenEXR v2 are:</p>
<p>* Deep Data. Pixels can now store a variable length list of samples.  The main rationale behind deep-images is to have multiple values at different depths for each pixel. OpenEXR v2 supports both hard surface and volumetric representation requirements for deep compositing workflows.</p>
<p>* Multi-part image files. With OpenEXR v2, files can now contain a number of separate, but related, images in one file. Access to any part is independent of the others; in particular, no access of data need take place for unrequested parts.</p>
<p>In addition, OpenEXR v2 also contains platform independent mechanisms for handling co-existing library version conflicts in the same process space. (Currently implemented in IlmImf)</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder that this is a Beta release and potentially incompatible changes may be introduced in future releases prior to the v2.0.0 production version.</p>

<h3>January 22, 2007</h3> - CTL has been released.
<p>
         The Color Transformation Language, or CTL, is a programming language
         for digital color management.  Color management requires translating
         images between different representations or color spaces.  CTL allows
         users to describe color transforms in a concise and unambiguous way
         by expressing them as programs.  In order to apply a given transform
         to an image, a color management system instructs a CTL interpreter to
         load and run the CTL program that describes the transform.
<p>
         The image viewers included in the OpenEXR software distribution,
         exrdisplay and playexr, both support color rendering via CTL.
         For more information see <a href="http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf">http://www.openexr.com/OpenEXRViewers.pdf</a>.
<p>
         Sorce code and documentation for the CTL interpreter can be
         downloaded from <a href="http://ampasctl.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">http://ampasctl.sourceforge.net</a>.  Please note
         the license under which CTL is distributed; it is similar but
         not identical to the OpenEXR license.

<h3>December 15, 2006</h3>

  <p>A new development version of OpenEXR is now available.
     We have tested the code in this version internally at ILM, but we would
     like to get feedback from others before we release a production version.
<p>
     The new version includes several significant changes:
	     <ul>
	     <li>OpenEXR supports a new image compression method, called B44.  It has
       a fixed compression rate of 2.28:1, or 4.57:1 if used in combination
       with luminance/chroma encoding.  B44-compressed images can be
       uncompressed fast enough to support real-time playback of image
       sequences.

     <li>The new playexr program plays back moving image sequences.  Playexr
       is multi-threaded and utilizes the threading capabilities of the IlmImf
       library that were introduced in OpenEXR 1.3.0.  The program plays back
       B44-compressed images with fairly high-resolution in real time on
       commodity hardware.

<li>The playexr program and a new version of the existing exrdisplay image
       viewer both support color rendering via color transforms written in
       the new Color Transformation Language or CTL. CTL is not part of OpenEXR; it will be released separately. CTL support in playexr and exrdisplay is optional; the programs can
       be built and will run without CTL.

<li>In preparation for the release of CTL, OpenEXR has been split into
       three separate packages:
<ul>
<li>IlmBase 0.9.0 includes the Half, Iex, Imath and IlmThread libraries

<li>OpenEXR 1.5.0 includes the IlmImf library, programming examples
            and utility programs such as exrheader or exrenvmap

<li>OpenEXRViewers 0.9.0 includes the playexr and exrdisplay programs
</ul>

<li>The "Technical Introduction to OpenEXR" document now includes a
       recommendation for storing CIE XYZ pixel data in OpenEXR files.

<li>A new "OpenEXR Image Viewing Software" document describes the
       playexr and exrdisplay programs.  It briefly explains real-time
       playback and color rendering, and includes recommendations for
       testing if other image viewing software displays OpenEXR images
       correctly.

<li>The OpenEXR sample image set now includes B44-compressed files and
       files with CIE XYZ pixel data.
      </ul>

<h3>August 8, 2006</h3>

<p>We have released an updated set of sample OpenEXR
         images.  This release includes several new images that are useful
         for testing OpenEXR applications.  The images are organized by
         subdirectory according to their image type or purpose.  Several
         of these subdirectories contain README files that explain the
         contents of the images in those subdirectories.</p>

<hr>

<h3>August 2, 2006</h3>

<p>OpenEXR 1.4.0 is now available.  This is the next
         major production-ready release of OpenEXR and offers full compatibility
         with our last production release, which was 1.2.2.  This version
         obsoletes versions 1.3.x, which were test versions for 1.4.0.
         If you have been using 1.3.x, please upgrade to 1.4.0.</p>
<hr>

<h3>June 8, 2006</h3>

<h4>OpenEXR 1.3.0 is now available.</h4>

<p>This is
             a test release.  The major new feature in this version is
             support for multithreaded file I/O.  We've been testing
             the threaded code internally at ILM for a few months, and
             we have not encountered any bugs, but we'd like to get some
             feedback from others before we release the production version.</p>
	     <p>
             Here's a summary of the changes since version 1.2.2:
	     <p>
	     <ul>
	     <li>Support for multithreaded file reading and writing.
             <li>Support for Intel-based OS X systems.
             <li>Support for Visual Studio 2005.
             <li>Better handling of PLATFORM_* and HAVE_* macros.
             <li>Updated documentation.
             <li>Bug fixes related to handling of incomplete and
                   damaged files.
              <li>Numerous bug fixes and cleanups to the autoconf-based
                   build system.
              <li>Removed support for the following configurations that
                   were previously supported.  Some of these configurations
                   may happen to continue to function, but we can't help
                   you if they don't, largely because we don't have any
                   way to test them:

		   <p>
		   <ul>
                   <li>IRIX
                   <li>OSF1
                   <li>SunOS
                   <li>OS X versions prior to 10.3.
                   <li>gcc on any platform prior to version 3.3
		   </ul>
		    </ul>
<hr>

<h3>March 15, 2005</h3>

<p>We're pleased to announce the release of OpenEXR 1.2.2.  This is a relatively minor update to the project, with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>New build system for Windows; support for DLLs.
	<li>Switched documentation from HTML to PDF format.
  <li>IlmImf: support for image layers in ChannelList.
  <li>IlmImf: added isComplete() method to file classes to check
      whether a file is complete.
  <li>IlmImf: exposed staticInitialize() in ImfHeader.h in
      order to allow thread-safe library initialization in
      multithreaded applications.
  <li>IlmImf: New "time code" standard attribute.
  <li>exrdisplay: support for displaying wrap-around texture map
      images.
  <li>exrmaketiled: can now specify wrap mode.
  <li>IlmImf: New "wrapmodes" standard attribute to indicate
      extrapolation mode for mipmaps and ripmaps.
  <li>IlmImf: New "key code" standard attribute to identify motion
      picture film frames.
  <li>Imath: Removed TMatrix&lt;T&gt; classes; these classes are still
      under development and are too difficult to keep in sync
      with OpenEXR CVS.
</ul>

<h3>August 10, 2004</h3>

<p>ILM's OpenEXR color management proposal,
     presented at the Siggraph 2004 "OpenEXR, Film and Color"
     Birds of a Feather meeting, is now available online.
     See the documentation section.</p>

<hr>

<h3>June 6, 2004</h3>

<p>OpenEXR 1.2.1 is now available.  This is a fairly minor release,
mostly just a few tweaks, a few bug fixes, and some new documentation.
Here are the most important changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduced memory footprint of exrenvmap and exrmaketiled
      utilities.</li>
  <li>IlmImf: new helper functions to determine whether a file
      is an OpenEXR file, and whether it's scanline- or
      tile-based.</li>
  <li>IlmImf: bug fix for PXR24 compression with ySampling != 1.</li>
  <li>Better support for gcc 3.4.</li>
  <li>Warning cleanups in Visual C++.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>May 11, 2004</h3>

<p>OpenEXR 1.2.0 is now available.  This is the first official,
production-ready release since OpenEXR 1.0.7.  If you have been using the
development 1.1 series, please switch to 1.2.0 as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We believe that OpenEXR 1.2.0 is ready for use in shipping applications.
We have been using it in production at ILM for several months now with no
problems.</p>

<p>There are quite a few major new features in the 1.2 series as compared to the original 1.0 series:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for tiled images, including mipmaps and ripmaps.  Note that
      software based on the 1.0 series cannot read or write tiled images.
      However, simply by recompiling your software against the 1.2
      release, any code that reads scanline images can read tiled images,
      too.</li>

  <li>A new Pxr24 compressor, contributed by Pixar Animation Studios.
      Values produced by the Pxr24 compressor provide the same range
      as 32-bit floating-point numbers with slightly less precision,
      and compress quite a bit better.  The Pxr24 compressor stores UINT
      and HALF channels losslessly, and for these data types performs
      similarly to the ZIP compressor.</li>

  <li>OpenEXR now supports high dynamic-range YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha)
      images with subsampled chroma channels.  These files are supported
      via the RGBA convenience interface, so that data is presented to the
      application as RGB(A) but stored in the file as YC(A).  OpenEXR also
      supports Y and YA (black-and-white/black-and-white with alpha)
      images.</li>

  <li>An abstracted file I/O interface, so that you can use OpenEXR with
      interfaces other than C++'s iostreams.</li>

  <li>Several new utilities for manipulating tiled image files.</li>
</ul>

code and sample images.</p>

<h3>Mar 27, 2004</h3>
<p>OpenEXR 1.1.1 is now available.  This another
development release.  We expect to release a stable version, 1.2,
around the end of April.  Version 1.1.1 includes support for PXR24
compression, and for high-dynamic-range luminance/chroma images
with subsampled chroma channels.  Version 1.1.1 also fixes a bug
in the 1.1.0 tiled file format.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Mar 27, 2004</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce that
Pixar Animation Studios has contributed code to OpenEXR
for a new lossy compression method, which compresses 32-bit
floating-point data quite a bit better than OpenEXR's other
compressors.  This new compressor is called PXR24 and is
available as of the 1.1.1 development release of OpenEXR.
It will also be included in the upcoming 1.2 stable release.
Thanks to Loren Carpenter and Dana Batali of Pixar, for making
this happen!</p>

<hr>

<h3>Feb 6, 2004</h3>
<p>OpenEXR 1.1.0 is now available.  This is a major new release
with support for tiled images, multi-resolution files (mip/ripmaps),
environment maps, and abstracted file I/O.  We've also released a new set
of images that demonstrate these features, and updated the CodeWarrior project and Photoshop plugins for this release.  See the <a
href="downloads">downloads</a> section for the source code and the new
images.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Jan 8, 2004</h3>
<p>Industrial Light & Magic has released the source code for an OpenEXR Shake plugin.
The plugin is supported on Shake 3.0 on the GNU/Linux and MacOS X platforms.  See the <a href="downloads">downloads</a> section.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Jan 7, 2004</h3>
<p>OpenEXR 1.0.7 is now available.  In addition to some bug
fixes, this version adds support for some new standard attributes, such as
primary and white point chromaticities, lens aperture, film speed, image
acquisition time and place, and more.  If you want to use these new
attributes in your applications, see the ImfStandardAttributes.h header
file for documentation.</p>

<p>Our project hosting site, Savannah, is still recovering from a compromise
last month, so in the meantime, we're hosting file downloads <a
href="downloads">here</a>.  Some of the files are not currently
available, but we're working to restore them.</p>
